# Pumpkin Pi
A Raspberry Pi Halloween project based on [@begillespie's PumpkinPi project](https://github.com/begillespie/Pumpkin_Pi/blob/master/pumpkinPi.py), using 6 LEDs.

GPIO pin out:
Pin  3: 5V power out
Pin  4: Ground
Pin 17: PIR motion sensor
Pin 20: White LED (eyeOne)
Pin 21: White LED (eyeTwo)
Pin 22: Yellow LED (yellow)
Pin 23: White LED (White)
Pin 24: Large Red LED (bigRed)
Pin 25: Large Yellow LED (bigYellow)

When the motion sensor is active, the "eyes" will open and the other leds blink in a random pattern.
